# Project Grotto Scrolls

Project Grotto Scrolls is a note taking and project management application.

This application is meant to be a replacement for my current note taking application, which also doubles as my personal project management application.

This is the backend for the Angular front-end and requires Java 16.

Grotto Scrolls is an internal project name. Once I have figured out a better name, I will change it, but the GitHub details will remain the same.
